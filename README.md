In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

npm test
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This allows you to run tests for your application.

npm run build
Builds the app for production. It creates an optimized and minified version of the application in the build folder.

npm run eject
Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

Ejecting from Create React App provides you with full control over the project configuration. It copies all the configuration files and dependencies into your project, allowing you to customize them. This is an irreversible action, and you should only use it when you are ready to take full control of the configuration.
